Hello you! I'm Collins aka KultureðŸ‘Œ

I'm an enthusiast of data analytics, data science, visualization, and lastly, machine/deep learning.I'm still in the early days of my career in data manipulation to achieve specific objctives in various fields like business, sports, healthcare, finance and my hobbies.

What have I done so far in recent years:
1) Experience: worked as an entry level data analyst where I used my set of skills to identify business problems and come up with  working solutions to improve and maximize a business profitability and  other data entry analyst experinces.
   
2) Education: I have taken several in-person and online courses, obtained certificates for exploration data analysis, data manipulation, data wrangling, data cleaning, data science and  data visualization. Still proceeding to add things to my toolbox. In the meantime, making analyses based on real-life data to consolidate them further.
